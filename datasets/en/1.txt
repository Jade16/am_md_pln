At 1:50 on 31-5-38 we stopped at @(Cobé). During the trip here we got caught in a hell of a rain.
Two leagues from @(Itabaiana) we crossed the @(Paraíba) River. Before @(Itabaiana) we passed by the Jararaca tile, we arrived at 3:30.
At 8:10 I finished my coffee. It consisted of one of the most absurd things for me: I drank half a glass of tar cognac on an empty stomach because I have a bad cold. We slept at &(João G. de Brito's) house, on top of the water tank. Yesterday I gave &(Ladeira) 20$000 to go look for Franca who would give us the "passport". He spent ten dollars on the car because of the


[3]
rain and the other $10,000 were for his personal expenses.
It seems I forgot my set of keys at @(J. Pessoa)!!!
After wasting time getting the truck ready until 9:45 we left &(João)'s house and went to "@(Rua de Itabaiana)” where he went to put gas in the car (the necessary for the trip). It must be after 10:30 and there is still no possibility of leaving. A guy from the cabocolinho filmed here informed us that &(mayor Santiago) still gave them 5$000 each after we left. Now that's what being stupid means!

We arrived in @(Campina) at 1 pm. We immediately went to unload the gasoline. 60 boxes that came from @(João Pessoa) (or @(Cabedelo)?, at 3$000 the transport of each is 180$000. A passenger came from @(Ingá do Bacamarte) who paid 5$000.

We left @(C. Grande) in the evening, heading to #Sertão. We had a snack before leaving. I had a bad fever and was feeling really bad. Shortly after the @(Bodocongó) dam, the steering cable broke and we had to stop. &(Pacheco) stayed in the truck and I, &(Martim) and &(Ladeira) went to @(Hotel de Campina). It was not possible to find today's newspapers from @(João Pessoa) here. The ones from @(Recife) are easily found. The guy at the hotel told me that newspapers from @(João Pessoa) sell at most 20 a day. Only lawyers and employees buy them. For the news, everyone looks for the newspapers from @(Recife). I took two more "Bromoquinine" pills that I have been taking since the afternoon and went to bed.
1-6-38
At 5 o'clock &(Ladeira) called me to let me know that &(João) had informed me that the piece that had broken had already been welded. At 6 o'clock I got up


[6]
There was no coffee with milk yet. I ate an orange. I tried to find out if it was possible to find the newspapers of @(João Pessoa). Impossible. Only after 8 o'clock. I gave up on buying them. I insisted on them because they must have an interview with me that was of a general report nature. We took a car from the square (10$000 spent by &(João) at 6:40 and went to the place where the truck had been parked. There we found &(Pacheco) who had slept in the truck itself. While &(José) was putting the welded part back in place, &(João), &(Ladeira) and &(Pacheco) were fixing the parts that carry the truck so that we could travel more comfortably.

Stopped at @(Corta Dedo) at 9:20. The urban and rural popular architecture of this area presents some interesting details. The house is systematically lower than that of the #backlands. The ceiling height here is small. The sides do not reach the height of 1.60. The finishing of the clay is also characteristic. A certain top is very similar to that of the rammed earth (real rammed earth) of São Paulo. The corners are systematically rounded. In this architecture there is no trellis; this is characteristic of the #backlands. Some brick houses still appear here. However, few.
Coffee in @(Corta Dedo). 9.30 $5,000 spent on coffee.
In @(Joazeiro) 14 leagues from @(Campina) and 14 leagues from @(Patos) we arrived at 10:50. We stopped to put gas in the truck. From @(Corta Dedo) &(Martim) started traveling on top, &(Pacheco) started traveling in the cab because &(João) didn't want to be there alone saying that the seat raised too much.


[8]
Sometimes these two types of wall are combined in the same construction.
At noon we arrived at the turnaround. Before starting the descent we noticed an abnormal noise and, when we stopped, we realized that the brake rod had broken. It was lucky that we noticed this there because if it had been during the turnaround we would have been… screwed. Here in @(Cariri) we see two things, besides those noted above, in the architecture: 1) the wattle and daub formed almost exclusively of wattle and daub. The walls made this way are predominantly filled in, in the gaps of the stone sticks (this is Cariri, and, in Cariri, the stone grows in the sand). Another type of wall can be seen here. It is the one made in the same way as the so-called "stick" or "lanço" fences. The way of arranging the sticks is the same as in the cleaning fence, except that in the cleaning fence the sticks are placed vertically and in the stick or haul fence and in this style of wall we are talking about the sticks (sticks) are placed horizontally.

departure to descend the wind: 12:30. We arrived at Salgadinho - the first town after the "wind" at 1:00 p.m. There we stopped and had the most lousy lunch in the world - rice and beans cooked with tallow, I swear to God, pasta (Paraíba is the state where most pasta is eaten), inedible chicken and turkey, green banana and marmalade that was like shit. Here in Salgadinho we found a "sui generis thermos": the coffee pot is heated in a "smothered" cloth:

In this hotel there is an interesting detail of hydraulic architecture #sertaneja


[drawing 12.1: section of a building with at least 5 roof pitches, with the gutters identified and passing through the building]


gutter
Note here that these gutters collect water from two roofs. The rainwater coming through the gutter in this house goes directly to the kitchen. Hotel bill: $24,000 (6 meals and 3 bottles of water)
Departure from this &(Salgadinho) 1.40?
of these $24 you have 1 water ($2,000) and 2 lunches
(6$000) from &(João). I didn't tip because the lunch was terrible.
Here you can also see a type of funnel used by boys (and old men) who carry water on the backs of donkeys.


[drawing 12.2: as identified, probably a gourd for carrying water]




[13]




Arrival in @(Pombal) at 6 (18) hours. After @(Viração) the presence of jurema is very intense. And umburana too.
Just before @(Patos) there is a distance of jurema that seemed to me to be the largest. Here (after the turn of the year) the trellises are already starting to appear. And also the houses with porches in the front.


[drawing 13.1: drawing of a house with a porch and a roof that extends and significantly reduces the ceiling height]


These houses are generally made of wattle and daub (tapia), which are already pronouncedly normal, that is, without any major regional distinguishing details, except for a certain persistence of the wattle and daub technique from Cariri. The roof is almost systematically made of tiles. Before @(Pombal) the oiticica trees already appear. In @(Pombal) I looked for &(Sá) Cavalcanti who came with us to the hotel where we had dinner. He paid for the dinner (we made about $30,000). &(Sá) told us that he had heard that an order had come from @(Rio) not to tear down the jail and the church.


[14]


We left @(Pombal) at 7:30 pm. We crossed the @(Rio Piranhas) without boats…… but water got into the car’s carburetor and &(Pacheco), &(João) and &(José) are struggling to solve the problem. Before the river, which is almost empty, about 30 men want to cheat passersby. After about 20 minutes of arranging the car we left and traveling on a more or less cold night we arrived in @(Souza) at 10:15 pm.
We came to the same hotel.
We left @(Souza) at 5 o'clock. At night the boy who "lent" me the notebook from the boat.
Departure @(Mariózopolis) 6 hours. 6 passengers 30$000. From @(Souza) to @(Alagoinha) @(Ceará) there is a long stretch of floodplain near @(Souza) and then another on a more rugged stretch


[15]


that reaches Cajazeiras and goes on until almost the border with @(Ceará). The presence of umburana and jurema can be seen here. In @(Ceará) the vegetation becomes very similar to the caatinga of @(Pernambuco). Vegetation of quince trees 2 meters high. A type of vegetation suitable for leather clothing. Near Lavras the carnauba appears; from six rice plantations. Lots of cotton. A traveling companion commented to another that cotton from the caatinga withers early.
At the entrance to @(Lavras) there is a small dam and the truck passes over a bleeder. In @(Lavras) there is a pine cone. There is a semi-squipathic imperial prison.
From @(Alagoinha) to near @(Lavras) 1 passenger.

At 11:20 we arrived at @(S. José). I entered the beginning of this place to find a Spanish courtyard! What a crazy thing. Inside the courtyard people behave as if they were on the street.

[drawing 17.1: Sketch of the floor plan of the described Spanish courtyard and signage of what appears to be the entry and exit flows]


These are sales that provide an entrance to the courtyard called cuméço.
On the way we saw a place @(Cajazeiras) on the right of the road (about 2,000 away). About halfway there we stopped at a house (a place called @(Maria) and then we asked
the distances and &(Pacheco) hurt his hand. I wrote down the locations @(Maria) and @(Cajazeiras) on the map.
In @(S. José) I spent $4,000 on guaraná. Departure from @(Maria) 12:30

We stopped near @(Várzea Alegre) (before getting off at Várzea we came to the shade to take care of the car, rest the engine, and make a cover against the sun. The wood for the cover was taken from a woven fence (name of this area)
This fence is like this


[drawing 18.1: drawing of a pole fence or fly fence]

This is already noted as being a pole fence or a haul fence. Here it is called a braided fence.
Arrival at @(Várzea Alegre) at 2:00 p.m. - 2:00 p.m. There was a huge problem regarding the road from here to @(Crato). The good thing is that the roads are really bad. I went to the city hall, but they didn't even know the altitude of the place. I managed to make a kind of itinerary with information gathered from several people there.

Here in @(Várzea Alegre) the same patio found in @(S. José) appears.
Don't forget to note in this area the redness of the clay used to make the wattle and daub walls. Also note that the porch is predominantly on the side of the porch. Trellises are rare. An interesting detail in the enormous popular houses in this area.

We slept in a place (1 house) called @(Guariba). &(Ladeira) and &(João) went to sleep at the house of a boy who had come with us. &(Martim) and &(Pacheco) slept in the house in front of which the truck and I and &(José) stayed. At 8 o'clock we arrived at the "bodega" of @(Monte Alegre). There we had a snack of "coalho" cheese, guaraná, "buttocks dirty coffee", sour orange and crackers. Here they sell Catuaba wine "which combats nervous prostration and organ weakness". (catu = good / aba = man). At 8:45 we left. I spent $28,500 on the sale.


[21]


A little further on from @(Monte Alegre) (still Monte Alegre) the truck got stuck in the Fortuna stream. To get out of there I had to work with a hoe, etc. I took a bath in the stream. A nice, fresh bath. Now at 12:10 I'm still reloading the truck that had been unloaded so I could leave the stream. The guy from Alagoas who lives nearby and with whom I had a good conversation is a friendly mulatto. The people from Ceará are a mungagueiro people. I can't get used to @(Ceará).

The new Cariri goes from @(Lavras) to the foot of @(Serra do Araripe). The vegetation is jurema, farela, quince, and occasionally a xique-xique or a mandacarú appears. The height of the vegetation here is more or less similar to that of the Pernambuco caatinga in the area of @(Tacaratu). The plantation of @(Várzea Alegre) is mainly rice. Further on, it is cotton, corn. Cassava grows but they don't plant it. The real Cariri is that constant zone of the "springs" at the foot of @(Serra do Araripe). All the "plantations" are there. You just have to plant it. After @(Várzea Alegre), especially here in @(Cipó) the population became friendlier. Sometimes umburana appears in this entire area of the entire Cariri. There is a fruit that grows a lot and is used to make soap and is cooked with lard. Name: cozido

Photo 4. House photographed from the truck with a trellis on the side and a wattle and daub railing (made of sticks stuck vertically) on the porch. Very red clay, like the rest of this area. Here in this area (shortly after @(Monte Alegre)) I saw a wattle and daub house with the same exterior appearance as the one at @(Sítio Santo Antonio) in @(S. Roque) @(S. Paulo) but it is a little smaller.

[31]


At 4:20 we left the Cipó store. Soon after we came across a steep slope where, in addition to what has been normal on this trip after @(Lavras) (filling holes, removing hillocks, etc.), we needed to dismantle (to rebuild after the car had passed) a 2m high pole fence.
There are several fencing systems around here. One type that was seen in @(Pernambuco), @(Tacaratú), appears frequently. It is the “bed fence on the ground” which consists of 2 sticks driven in at an angle at a distance from each other (1 to 2 m) like this:


[drawing 31.1: bed fence on the ground, with two pieces of wood]






There is another type, which is the pole fence. Here the technique is as follows: sticks are planted 1 to 2 meters apart and rods whose length reaches, at the


[32]


[drawing 32.1: type of fence]
minimum 3 staked sticks. The series for placing the sticks is erected from one span to the next and so on. There is also the fence made of bread and wattle, which is made of sticks simply stuck into the ground, one next to the other. After all, there is the cleaning fence (it is known here but I have not yet seen one in this area of @(Cariri)). Late at night, at 10 o'clock, we managed to get the car out of the place (it was still Cipó) where we knocked down the fence. Before arriving at the place @(“Logradouro”) (where we landed) we had to cross a river… little. &(Pacheco), at my suggestion, had gone ahead to see if he could find something to eat at the “handkerchief” store that they said was nearby. When we came back he said he had found this @(Rio Fundo) of 2 m and called it a hard “empáio”. Then we went to check if it was


lacráio = scorpion around here (there are rocks).


[33]


sand H2O earth


[drawing 33.1: profile of the small river indicating sand, water and land]


a shallow stream that we crossed quickly. We stopped at 11:00 p.m. at the place “Logradouro” where we arranged a place to stay with old &(Boaventura). &(Pacheco) slept in the back of the car. Then I sent &(Joaquim) (Caboclo who is helping with the roadside stalls) to get something to eat at the Cipó store. He spent 15,680 and brought XXXXX bottles of cognac, biscuits, and rapadura. He arrived with all of this already in order at 1:00 a.m.
June 4, 1938. I woke up at 5 o'clock and got the others up. &(Martin) walked a little and the inexplicable semicolon very inexplicable: finding a possible detour to the stone slope that we needed to climb while descending the final load. In the end, all we had to do was pull out some weeds and a canafístula tree (canafístula) closed and the car went up. The coffee was simple and with a biscuit that tasted like cockroaches on top. While they were climbing the


[34]
car on the 1st slope of the street, &(Pacheco) and I went to fix the 2nd slope of this place, so that the car could pass, we only needed a little more dirt in the hole. Then the car passed too. I paid &(Boaventura), who by the way got me some green oranges, $3,200 + $5,000
There is milk here, there is milk, there isn't milk here. Earlier today a local country boy passed by me with his gourd and I asked if he sold it. He ran away saying no. The old man told me that there is milk in @(Piauí). There is no mineral water, guaraná or anything like that around here. I have never felt so thirsty in my life as I feel now in this #Sertão carrasqueiro of @(Ceará) (here the type of vegetation is Carrasco). The carrasco is low-lying.
The difference between Carrasco and Caatinga for the locals is the height of the vegetation. The Carrasco vegetation is low-lying. In this Carrasco there are xique xique, mandacaru, macambira. Facheiro does not have any.


[35]
We are really hungry. Today, when I went to take a shit, I almost didn't shit because there is nothing to shit. I only shit corn and a little. Right after the 2nd hill we had a small fight. The danger is that the car is breaking down. It is in the interval of this fight that I am writing. It is 8:30. It seems that after all we are close to the place called @(Lenço) (it is a farm) where we should find the road that comes from @(Quixará) and that, they say, has truck traffic to @(Crato). The layout of the house where we sleep is like this

The truck passed by me as I was writing and stopped there in front. When I arrived, &(Pacheco) had no one looking after it. &(Ladeira) and &(Martim) left the car with the material on the road. &(Pacheco) went there now to send someone back because I also want to take a bath in the @(Cedro) reservoir.
The place where we spent the night is called @(Cedro) and the slopes are called @(Lafeira do Cedro). @(Logrador) is the place a little behind where we crossed the river that &(Pacheco) said was empaio. The @(açude do Cedro) is privately owned by &(João Salvino).
House wood: mastic (support and filling)
(filling is the braiding) Cedar: for the door. Canafístula for the window. Quince for the slats. The lashing is made with real vine. Quince rafters. Braúna jambs. The web is made in the pottery.


[37]
At 9 o'clock the worst of the troubles in the 7 leagues that go from @(Várzea Alegra) to @(Lenço) ended. At 10:30 we arrived at the place called @(Contenda) where they had to repair the road to get through. The sun is shining like hell. &(João) is the kind of captain of the woods. Helpful and polite with his superiors and rude with his subordinates. Soon after entering the “royal road” we found a fiberglass house (the first one here in @(Ceará) It was very basic, with a roof and walls made of birdseed straw.

This house is very small and… transparent




[drawing 37.1: sketch of the floor plan of the 'fiber' house]
Further on, in @(Contendas) we still had to stop for a while to repair the road.
[38]


We have XXXX here
There are a lot of children here and women hardly ever wear red. Black hair is very rare here. When people don't have Dutch hair, it's mixed race.


We stopped a little further on at a house where we heard they sold bananas!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There we tricked our stomachs a bit. I couldn't resist my thirst any longer and drank water served there at the house. I'm hoping my stomach might get upset because of that. There at the house where they sold us bananas there was a healthy, plump, hypersexual country girl. With her arms raised and hands holding onto a swing pole, swinging her full, rounded body, she made us forget about our figure, thirst and hygiene. She was worse than any catuaba tea.


[39]


From @(Contenda) to @(Crato), they say here, there are 6 leagues.


This catuaba is a tree that grows in the @(Araripe mountain range). The tea made from its bark, its wine, is a turn-on. They say that all it takes is for one person to set up a hammock under it to… set up a circus. In @(Crato) they make a wine from its bark. The label of this wine shows an old man sitting at a table and a woman with her skirt lifted up showing her garter (I don't know why this drawing looks like it was made in France at the end of the last century, although it was certainly made in this area of @(Juazeiro). The main crops continue to be cotton, corn and rice. The people – &(João) and &(Calunga) – are getting a “mulésta” hillside.
Having finished these notes above, I slept in the bed of a nameless stream that was dry. After the truck passed, &(Ladeira) came to call me and we walked safely 1 kilometer to reach the truck that was again stopped for repairs on a slope.


[40]
Here they wear espadrilles a lot but not leather clothes. I haven't seen one of those yet. There's a lot of faggot leather. According to &(João), today, Saturday, we should be at the fair in @(Picos), in @(Piauí). I'll be happy if we get to @(Crato).

[drawing 40.1: truck passing through the roads]


Sometimes the roads in the @(northeast) take the riverbed. This photo, for example. It is a river that is dry. Its bed is very cobbled. Just today it looks like a car has already passed by here. They say that a few days ago a car carrying pigs passed by.


This stream is called “Passage of the Horses”


[41]


I don't know if it's on this road. We need to remove rocks from the riverbed so the car can pass. It's really hot. The shade is a lot more pleasant. I've been noticing for a while that the difference in temperature between the sun and the shade here in the @(northeast) is quite large. At night, it's actually cold in this area of @(Ceará). But what could be the cause of such a notable difference in temperature between the sun and the shade? The low atmospheric density, which also causes an extraordinary distance to the sky and gives such great visibility? Or could it really be the consistency of the terrain! This same terrain is incapable of retaining water, which runs off a lot in the rain and all goes away leaving the earth dry. It seems to me that this same terrain, with the "envisagement" of the vegetation, is incapable of transmitting heat. Another thing, the rocks we've found on the paths and


[42]
that we often need to break or crumble seem rotten. They are almost all alluvial accumulations, presenting the same appearance of many sheets stuck together that is seen in micas. In these stones, a single blow from the hoe is enough for them to break easily, sometimes following the direction of the sheets that form their structure and other times, less frequently, crumbling completely as if they were not rotten.
I have never felt so hungry and thirsty in my life. Not even in 1932.
I'm also a bit dirty, but not so much on my body, because yesterday I took a bath in the river, but my clothes are really filthy. My white jacket is in a dismal state and stinks. I'm still having a little flu. The crops here are cotton and corn.
[43]
They say it is near a place called @(S. Sebastião) which should be two leagues away from @(Contenda). It seems to me that, if we haven't walked two leagues, we won't be far. The situation is becoming discouraging. I've never seen flies so little afraid as the ones that are circling me here. We have to touch them with our hands to make them fly away. They only care about us if we wave.

We arrived at 4:00 p.m. in @(São Sebastião) (current name of @(Ipueiras). The place was a fair. In the center of the street there was a 5 x 10 m shed. Without walls. Inside it was a fair, a zabumbeiro band (also called a cabaçal) and a flag bearer who took alms. This band is made up of a zabumba, a snare drum and a “fifaro couple” (2 married). Every now and then the band leaves with the flag bearer in front. They walk around the central tent and return to sit in the place where they were photographed.
On one side of the street, the houses reach the end of the sidewalk with their porches. This is where the fan detail seen in @(São Paulo) appeared. The place has two uninteresting chapels. We ate at a crappy hotel. We ate a lot and there was even pineapple. We ate a lot.
It's 5 o'clock and it's already getting dark.


[46]
expenses in @(S. Sebastião):
4 cigarettes 4$800 (one for &(Martim), one for &(Ladeira), one for &(Zé Calunga))
and another for me
waters:
Total (with note) $37,800
Given to the piper: 1$000


Departure @(S. Sebastião): 17 hours and 50 m.
At about 7:15 pm, going up a hill in a place called @(Arrodeadô) the truck couldn't handle the hill because it was coming in second gear and, letting go, almost went into a ravine on the left. &(Martim) only jumped like a very agile person, which he doesn't seem to be.
In an attempt to get the car out of that mess, the same thing happened, bringing the car into a similar and… even more dangerous position.




[47]
If there hadn't been a rock there that I sent a kid to get, we would have been screwed because the log that the guy put under the rear wheel was thrown sideways into the back of the car.
It was then decided to unload. I stayed there for a while and then came to inquire about this store about 50 fathoms ahead. They told me that we had already gone 2 leagues and still had three more to go, which we would clear in an hour. The crops here are rice and corn. Cotton is only found in the higher places, and here it is a lowland.
It's 20 hours + or - I paid $4,000 to those who helped
At ….. o'clock we left this mess and headed forward. One or another hill always bothered us. We even had to repair the road in certain sections. We walked for leagues and … leagues and still didn't reach the 3 leagues that they said were left to @(Crato).
5-6-38
At midnight we were on our way to @(Crato) and nothing from this city arrived. An annoying rain dirtyed the car windows and wet… all of &(Zé Calunga)'s clothes.


[48]


or - at 24:40 we found a road that led to the one we were coming from. There was no other way but to ask and wake people up. In the end they told us we were close and that in 20 minutes we would enter @(Crato). The architecture of 1 hour before arrival changes a lot.
a) the house becomes too small; b) the wattle and daub technique is also combined with that of straw. While before the porch looked like this:


[drawing 48.1: sketch of a house with a porch]


appears systematically, here it disappears to give way to straw and wattle and daub houses where the ridge (ridge) is perpendicular to the entrance.
Today during the day, after @(Lenço) I found a very interesting construction due to the richness of its forms and the arrangement of the enormous balcony. It is certainly an individualistic case but it is interesting as a curiosity.

It was more or less like this

Once we arrived in @(Crato) we headed to @(Crato Hotel). It seemed to have good facilities. At least it had a hammock. We ate orange candy in syrup and drank mineral water.
It's 2 o'clock and I'm going to sleep. Tomorrow we'll leave maybe at 9 o'clock in the morning.
5-6-38 I got up at 7:30 and went to call the guys. &(João) went out to see something about the truck. Now, at 9 o'clock, we are just waiting for it to leave.
Hotel Expense $39,900 + $3,000 tip
I am going to telegram from here to &(Mário) in these terms: &(Mário de Andrade). @(Rua Lopes Chaves nº 546). @(São Paulo). State of @(São Paulo).
Traveling @(Saint Louis). All right. &(Leave).


Lunch in @(Crato). cost 39$200 (for 6 people)
Departure 11:30 towards @(Campos Sales)


[51]
Photo 7 - blind guy from @(Crato) who gave us a beggar's tune &(Martim) has the notebook where his name is written by me along with the lyrics of the tune.
He gave the information more or less timidly. He is illiterate. A mixed-race country boy.


At 1:50 pm we are going up the mountain. Going up is a way of saying because we are stopped in front of @(Campo Alegre store).
Inside, a group of 10 people in various positions are completely still, listening to one of them who is telling a story quietly and slowly. Slowly. There are some huge coffee plants here.


[52]
14:10 we are on the @(ladeiras das Guaribas) (which comes from the place of the previous store where there were coffee trees) right after these slopes is the mountain plateau. From here you can see @(Juazeiro).
Here in this place there is a purge station. This is because a week ago there were 5 or 6 cases of bubonic plague in @(Pernambuco) - in @(Serra da Inveja). There are a lot of bananas here. Some papayas. The water is dirty, as always. Here there are some signs of dirt, but it is not colored.
The roofs of the houses are covered with straw from Morondongo coconuts and Macaúba palms. Straw from Morondongo coconuts is used more.
House plans seen shortly after leaving @(Crato) long before here.

[53]
The woman from @(Crato) is very good. There are black women in the area and the rural women are also very appetizing. They almost never wear red dresses.
In the many donkey herds that we find around here, they are tied together in pairs. The closed-wheel ox carts appear all over Paraíba and Ceará (in this area we also traveled). The women wear flowers on their heads. There is jurema here. On the other side of this Serra do Araripe is Novo Exu.
In this mountain range there is a @(spring of the Batateira) that they will use for the hydraulic plant to supply electricity to @(Crato). There are also water-powered machines in these marshes at the foot of @(Serra do Araripe). There are castor oil plants around here. There are jatobá (many large trees). There is that little fruit from the fences of @(São Carlos) that they call melon (?). There is taboca (sugarcane from India) in @(São Paulo)
At the purge station here they play Swedish


[54]
The peccary vine is used here to tie fences. Here, there is also caçuá made from this peccary vine. This plant is found in @(São Paulo).

16:10 We stopped at a place called @(Moita) (previously called @(Capuêro) the owner of the house invariably says: - this is the house, @(Moita) is where the car is.
The area is called serra. From here, 2 and a half leagues go down to #sertão


[55]
The little red flower that borders the road is churiço de moça.
Large tree called bathtub (whose fruit has a seed covered in butter, from which comes the name chicken lard)
The 50cm trees in the fields here are velame and marcela (mallow). Here there are agouti (which eats chicken fat from the bathtub)


Photo 8 = types of girls from @(Moita) - plateau of @(Serra do Araripe)


We arrived at 7:45 pm in @(Araripe). The district is celebrating. There is a ground-floor platform set up on the street and they are auctioning off 2 glasses of beer for $1,500.
The bar has billiards and a battery-powered radio - &(Carmem Miranda). Here in @(Araripe) there is also a quadrangular beginning on the street. I didn't see this beginning from the inside, but I was told that there is a porch around it.


[56]
Soon after our arrival I ordered the buoy to be fixed. &(Pacheco) and &(Ladeira) went to the cruise ship where they fixed nothing. I was looked for by the police chief who then went to call the father. They were talking nonsense.
@(Ceara)
M. District Judge (County of @(Assaré) &(Vicente Gonçalves de Figueiredo). He was uninformed about local folklore.


I was with a traveler from @(Fortaleza) studying a travel plan for him throughout this area of @(Cariri). I went to sleep at midnight. XXXXXX good. After entering the room I went out to see the light and saw the woman from the boarding house... in her underwear running away from me. I slept well. I woke up in the morning, at 5 am, at the call of &(João). A little while later the local band (It's not local, it's from @(Campos Sales) broke out furiously in a XXXX double. Loud fireworks accompanied the band. The music of the roosters too. What a party!!!
We had coffee, I paid the bill ($30,000) and we are waiting for the car to be repaired before leaving.

There are 2 types of milk pumpkin (the inside is more red and tasty). They also call it pumpkin. And the flatter one with a lighter skin is the pumpkin caboclo. It has white flesh and is more elongated in shape and a darker skin, green tending towards brown.
They use pomegranate as medicine (tea or chewed peel used to gargle. They use the paste on wounds.
Macaúba coconut (note the pronunciation of the y) They make edible rosaries from catolé coconut.
Departure 7 am.

6-5-38


Departure from @(Araripe) at 7 o'clock sharp. On a bad road (not even close to the one in @(Várzea Alegre)) we made the journey @(Araripe) @(Campos Sales) in 2 hours sharp, arriving at @(Campos Sales) at 9. This area we are passing through is already very dry because it doesn't rain anymore after April or May. Winter was short this year. The architecture of the area we traveled through, without having the vastness noted previously, is advantageous. With rare exceptions, the porch is on the waterfall (Portuguese influence). The entrance through the porch door is almost never seen, except sporadically. The predominant technique is the pau-a-pique (I speak São Paulo).
On the plateau of @(Serra do Cariri) there are interesting aspects in the architecture. The houses have their entrance in front of the porch, which is remarkably long. There are no windows on the sides. Almost systematically the first division section is empty and serves as a porch. It is also very common to see two houses together like this.

From time to time, the Latada appears on this plateau. In @(Araripe) &(Pacheco) going to the cruise saw there a head with characteristics of mental regression. It was despised by this poor man.
From @(Campos Sales) to @(Socorro) the architecture varies a lot
Here comes a type of addition to the house of this type

The vegetation in this area is caatinga. Everything is completely dry. It is true that demagogy is forbidden by saying that there is not a single green leaf. That is not true. The pear tree does not dry out. The xique-xique, mandacaru, facheiro and coroa de frade are also green. The facheiro is used to make jam. The mandacaru is fed to cattle. The absolute predominant vegetation is umburana. It is almost all you can see on the side of the road. The quince tree is abundant and dry. The angico and the favela do not appear so frequently. There is a “goat’s beard” in the lowlands that they call grass…
Every now and then, although very rarely, the trellis appears around here.
We entered the State of @(Piauí) precisely at 9:45 in a place called @(Lagoa Seca). Further on there is a place called @(Capela).
You see a lot of #sertanejo on these roads… it is, above all, a fort. In @(Piauí) we saw a #sertanejo working near a fence


[62]
On the way we saw flocks of Gangá (it looks like a parakeet but bigger and all green on top). We saw the tetéu | gray wader | this is the one that sleeps with its foot on its head. When it dozes off, its foot slips and it wakes up. Silly animal. There are woodpeckers. The Maria de Barro. There are a lot of sheep around here.

Departure from @(Socorro) to @(Boa Esperança) at 1:30 pm, the trip was more or less good. Through caatinga and #backlands. Sometimes the caatinga in this area looks like that of @(Pernambuco) and in certain parts like that of #backlands in @(Paraíba) (a park). There are almost no houses around here.
Departure from @(Boa Esperança) 16:30 - same same
Arrival at @(Jaicós) 18:10 - (10$000 transport of boys from @(Socorro) to @(Jaicós). This city is very interesting. It has a market with a porch on three sides. The square is uneven and square and large. In front, the century-old church has a high platform that ends in a staircase in front of which there is a cross. The prison is square and has two floors.

[66]
In view of the promise that &(João) made to me that we would be in @(Picos) tomorrow at 8 am, I postponed our departure until dawn.
We will probably leave at 5 in the morning. We will sleep right here in @(Jaicós), at the guesthouse where we had dinner with rice, pasta, eggs, sun-dried meat, pork, turkey, and natural water. I ate, with &(Ladeira) and &(Martim) a small green papaya. The owner of the guesthouse is an ugly but friendly woman in her fifties (from São Paulo). She told me to my face that she was very happy when the opportunity arose for good guests. Before dinner I was talking to a traveler who admires @(Leonardo Mota). We disagreed. Later, after dinner, he was talking to &(Pacheco) and when I joined the conversation, he seemed submissive and cordial. &(Pacheco) certainly told him why we had come. He gave me some information. He said, for example, that a few days ago he heard in @(Quixadá) @(Ceará) - near @(Várzea Alegre) a song by a deputy (munching)


[67]
baller??


in the rice harvest there. About 30 girls in the choir and another male voice. In the far north - Amazonas - he says, the work song is ajurí. He spoke of the mirage of the @(7 cities) existing in the north of this state or in @(Ceará), I don't know now. In @(São Luís), he says, the blacks settled in the stevedoring area. In the lower city there is samba and catimbó in @(São Luís). In @(Fortaleza) there is also catimbó. Maybe even here in this area of @(Picos) and @(Jaicós) something can be found about it. I have asked about #sertanejo romance and, so far, nothing.
I was forgetting an interesting detail about the doors of a rural house in the @(Campos Sales) - @(Socorro) area. It's the following: in a mud house (pau-a-pique in @(São Paulo)), covered with tiles (as they systematically use here, the door consisted of a

[69]
7-6-1938 &(João) came to wake me up at 3:15 am. I was upset. At 5 am we got up and after a quick and simple coffee we left. After walking 2 kilometers the radiator propeller turned off and broke it. &(João) said, at first, that the radiator shaft had “bent”. We later verified that the thing (propeller) was just turned off. We went back to the entrance of the street. I changed the film in the camera and we went to visit the church. It is from 1837 (it has an inscription with the date on the front)
Inside it still preserves part of the original design, although it has new saints and beasts. Not a single large image. All mediocre. The ceiling of the main chapel is like this


[drawing 69.1: sketch of the shape of the geometry of the main chapel]


Unadorned. Not a single detail of beauty or interest. The candlesticks, which are the most elaborate pieces of wood, are ugly and inelegant, maintaining the same old catiçalal line from @(São Paulo). The pulpits (only one of the two that exist is working) are circular and poorly decorated.


[70]


consisting of intertwined initials (the same ones found on the ceiling of a main chapel in @(Recife)) surrounded by 2 unrecognizable leafy branches, all in high relief. The patron saint wears a beautiful silver crown. Speaking of silver, I was told that in @(Oeiras) there is a concentration of silver workers. The silverware there is very good, they say, and is highly sought after. Perhaps this crown comes from there. It is good. This church has many doors that open and, because of its high location, when they open you can see the city in several directions with good visibility. It may be clean (there are still bats) and certainly very ventilated, especially very windswept.
This evening it was so windy that you could hear it from the hammock like it was raining. It's still windy now and the landlady said it's like this all year round.


[71]


At breakfast we drink milk and coffee accompanied by rice couscous (the rice is soaked in water, then crushed and placed in a cloth (the couscous maker)) and tapioca (the tapioca (manioc, as they say here) is mashed to make gum. Then they mix water and a bit of salt and cook it). During the drought of 1932, the caboclos ate a lot of roots and sticks, causing some cases of illness. The state government sent doctors here who took all kinds of tubers and roots that had been eaten for analysis. The caboclos here normally eat tapioca, game meat and some other root or stick.
Here in @(Jaicós) there are 2 springs (one for bathing and one for drinking) the water is not that bad and is drinkable.

Diary of 7-6-38 - Then at 4:15 in the morning &(João) came to wake me up so we could leave. I woke up, although I was already half awake because of the wind that seemed like a storm. At 5 o'clock we got up in a hurry and after a quick coffee we left. About 2 kilometers out of the city after a minor climb, we noticed some kind of problem with the truck. The inspection showed that the water pump had broken, breaking the radiator. The situation was discouraging. They said it would take 5 days or more, so we went back to @(Jaicós) and stopped in front of the local priest's house. Then we realized that nothing was broken and that the propeller had only come off, seriously damaging the radiator. The whole problem was now limited to the radiator.


[78]
After spending some time near the car, we went back to the guesthouse to have some coffee. This was as it is on pages 69 to 71 of this notebook. I wrote a bit and then went to the truck to change the film in my camera, which had run out. After this job with &(Pacheco), I went to take pictures of the church and visit it. After the church, my attention turned to the jail, which is an extremely interesting building due to its cleanliness (I'm speaking architecturally), seriousness and elegance. It is a building from the last century, rectangular, almost square and two-story. The balance of proportions is perfectly achieved, as I have rarely seen. Above all, it has the character of a jail that is hard to find. The one in @(Pombal), for example, is exaggeratedly squat.


[79]
It's beautiful, without a doubt. The roof is big and predominant. But it's squat. The one in @(Manguape) is stupid and practically imperial. Painted in red. Inelegant. This one in @(Jaicós) is a serious, white prison, an honest prison.
Another interesting building here in @(Jaicós) is a house with a portal sketched on page 72 of this notebook. Unfortunately, I was unable to see the interior layout of the house because the owner was ill. However, I did find out one thing: the residential architecture of @(Jaicós) always has an entrance with a small communication hall (like those found in @(Itu), @(São Paulo), but without the stairs leading up. They are practically ground floor.


[80]
The climb systematically takes place on the sidewalk, which is always high and, sometimes, with stairs invading the street.
The layout of the guesthouse where we are staying is like this:


[drawing 80.1: floor plan of the guesthouse where the team stayed, indicating the rooms]


C, D, E, G = rooms
M = dining room
N = porch
B = deposit
A = kitchen


The walls that separate the rooms from the corridors reach the ceiling, but those that separate the rooms from each other reach the height of the minimum ceiling.


[81]
Whoever tells the story of the Troncoso grows a tail during the day


The kitchen does not have an external wall that is closed. This is only halfway up and then there is a wooden railing. The house has, like all the urban houses here (except the prison), 2 developed waters (in Portuguese) towards the front.
Even before lunch I went to see the work that was being done on the radiator - which had the bitch I'm writing about - when I got there they were finishing filling the holes in the radiator with cement.
The composition of the mortar was 1.5 x 1. The sand was dirty and the mortar was poorly mixed. I made another 1 x 1 mortar, well mixed, and put it in the radiator. I expected it to set in ½ hour, at about 11 o'clock, and I told &(João) that he should try adding water only at 2 o'clock.


[82]
The welder showed me the skin of a jaguar that was hunted 12 leagues from here. It is a huge, very dark hide with black spots. This man also has the head of this jaguar. He has four of these masters of... carnivory. They say that a man cannot walk alone in certain areas around here without being caught by a jaguar. When a jaguar manages to hunt a large animal - a man, a calf - it carries it on its back after walking for a while and hides it. If you discover meat hidden like this, you can ambush the jaguar and it will certainly return to the potato patch. Here at the welder's house, there are still some antlers from a deer that came from @(Goiás).
We had lunch at 11:30. Pasta, beans, rice, eggs, chicken, banana and coffee.


[83]
After lunch I slept a bit, then went to see about the radiator. When I got there at 3 pm, @(João) had already XXXXX put water in and, as he hadn't waited for the time I had set... water leaked and then they removed all the cement that had been put in and that rascal @(João Bianô) made a mortar with only cement and water, which he was finishing putting in the radiator. Then I spent a lot of time chatting with the people. @(Bianô) started telling some unfunny stories and a guy from here said that telling stories about the trunk during the day will make your ass grow on the meter. I was upset because it seems that this trip is getting delayed more and more. We certainly won't arrive in @(Teresina) until 3 days from now and in @(São Luís) at the earliest on the 11th or 12th. It's bad.


[84]
In addition to the cement placed in the radiator, some sections were welded. We will only check tomorrow morning to see if it is still leaking. After leaving there, I went with &(Pacheco) and &(Ladeira) to visit the spring where the locals get their water.


[drawing 84.1: sketch of the water spout]

The women of @(Piauí) are good and very sexual. There are some black people around here. A mulatto girl who was coming back from the tap was absolutely sexual. Her figure seemed to want to rip her dress. Her ass was big and separated. Appetizing. They are generally round-sided, with a certain dryness only in the older ones. The men here are dry and lean in their flesh, with the exception of the German vicar.

who is disgustingly fat with radio, gramophone, little monkey refrigerator, listening to South American time on shortwave on his radio whose battery is charged by a local Marian (one hour of work turning a crank for 5 hours of battery operation) During the visit we made at night to this priest and he doubled German with &(Martim) and informed that the old images had been burned. Then I managed to inform him that there was the use of the reisado (bumba-meu-boi) in the place but it had kind of disappeared. On the recommendation of the local bandmaster and in his company I went to the house of a certain &(Alfredo) who lives in a broken-down shack nearby
This &(Alfredo) took us to his father who came with me to give us some bumba-meu-boi songs from here that they call reisado.


[86]
In @(Picos), they say here, there is a working kingship and in @(Floriano) there are also Congo kings. The local priest asked &(Martim) to take a package to the curate of the church in &(Picos). Maybe there is some interesting image there. There are some black people in this area. So far I have not found anything in terms of #sertanejo romance despite my insistent search. I am thinking of buying a deer hide (almost $7,000) that is full of lead holes and tanned. Now I have decided to buy deer hide even if it is not tanned because in @(São Luís) I will be able to easily (they say here) tan it. The jaguar hide, although not for sale, was valued at $50,000. This place is quite dry and also uninhabited.


[87]
Three leagues away from here there is a cross where miracles are performed (the priest said he will have it burned). For fun and pastime I have been playing a lot with the endó-tiriri that I am trying hard to remember where I heard or read about. No one knows about it. After dinner (6 o'clock) we visited the priest, I picked up the singer of the reisado, came to the boarding house with him and after that I went to visit the truck so that, on the way back, I could write this nonsense. Everyone is asleep and you can hear the radio outside in the street.
I'm going to look at the street and go back to sleep.
End of day 7-6-38
Day 8-6-37. At 6:30 I woke up and learned from &(Ladeira) that &(João) had already left.


[88]
At 7 I got up and went out onto the street.
It wasn't as windy tonight. I had coffee (with milk and 2 types of cakes, one similar to a sequilho and the other with a sweet called a bomb). After breakfast I went to see what condition the radiator repair was in. When I got there I found João and Bianor making new cement because the one they had put in yesterday hadn't worked. I was really pissed off and left there intending to make the most of the day anyway. I went to get horses but soon realized it would be very difficult. They told me that the only person who could rent them was a merchant who, when I went there and asked, told me that his horses were 3 leagues away from the "street". I went back to the front of the boarding house. Then the owner of the boarding house tried to get me a horse. A horseman stopped in front of a house a little above the boarding house. I asked him if he wanted to rent the horse.


[89]
He answered me negatively because he was leaving for the trip. I was really discouraged about finding animals to go on the cruise when the horseman who had stopped there a little while before came to offer me his horse and two others that he could find for... an outrageous price. $30,000. I was pissed off at the rip-off because, as I later found out, the price was too high. The custom is to rent an animal for $5,000 per day. In the end, we reached an agreement for $24,000. At 8:30 a.m. I left with &(Pacheco) on the donkey that is fat and rides well. I went on a lazy little donkey. I grabbed a bag from the truck and we left. Just before leaving the “street” I decided to change the stirrup that I didn't get on well with, because the only possible support was on the tips of my toes. This type of stirrup, with a medieval look, is very common here.


[90]
It is made of metal and has the following shape:


[drawing 90.1: drawing of the metal stirrup]


It seemed to be made of copper. I changed the stirrup and... we left the "street". Our guide, who gave me the stirrup for his saddle, went to his house to get his own saddle. In addition to some mixed-race kids who were under the trellis, two girls appeared at the door and window. One was a little girl, about 7 to 10 years old, pretty and mixed-race; the other was a young girl, thin, with strong breasts, beautiful in the face... and spitting on the side. But beautiful in the face and with a sincere and affectionate look for me.
Well, we set off to enter a caatinga that never ends. The terrain is, in principle, a vast sandy plain. The vegetation rises to 2 or 3 meters in height, very dry and brittle. The predominant species is jurema. There is jurema that even seems to be the “city of jurema” here. Then there are the quince trees, the pear trees. Some umburanas. Cacti: xique-xique, mandacaru (this one never dries out).


[92]
sandy terrain on the flat parts and invariably stones on the slopes. This stone is always crumbly and looks rotten.
Since the terrain is almost always exposed, the wind has an erosive effect, digging holes in these rocks or giving them whimsical rounded shapes. Every now and then we pass by a field of cassava and cotton. You can see some watermelons or gourds in the middle of these fields enclosed by a fence. The distance we were told was 3 leagues between @(Jaicós) and Serra dos @(3 Irmãos) (3) (someone said up to 2 leagues), but the truth is that we only got there after a good 5 leagues. &(Pacheco) is broken and halfway there he asked to rest for a while. Halfway there you can see the mountain range in the distance, from a place where the caatinga gives way to a small open space.


[93]
Just before reaching the base of the mountain, we see a group of straw houses that are almost at the foot of it. The horses go up and we enter this group of houses, climbing well over 50 meters. From there, there is a staircase that was dug into the rock by the priest who comes here to say mass during festivals. The staircase does not always follow the same direction. It curves around looking for the gentlest slope, which must have a gradient of about 70%. We reach the top. The cross is leaning against a recently built wall. There is a chest for collecting alms built into it. Ahead of the cross, there is a platform full of stones and pebbles that ends about 30 meters from a vast precipice that is over 200 meters high. Along this platform, there are several tombs of people who died - &(João) informs us - 3, 2, or 4 leagues away and are brought in nets. Right in the middle of this platform, there are a lot of miracles.


[94]
Almost only legs and arms and hands and feet. Exposed as they are to the rain and sun, they have rotted a lot. There are a few uninteresting heads. 2 entire mutilated bodies. A wasted trip!!! A head recently placed there is not very interesting. Another is absolutely rotten and perhaps it was somewhat interesting. Today, nothing is worth anything. I collected 3 pieces... for the honor of the company.
From the edge of the cliff - here comes the demagogy, my God - the landscape of the caatinga in the distance looks like a sea of blue and so straight that it stretches all around. Only behind us, in the southwest direction, can we see the Araripe mountain range, behind which lies part of the state of Pernambuco. Up here, Pacheco and I were looking at some rocks. It has a yellowish plaster of a very fine consistency. We saw a large rock 50 meters high. The large rocks that top the ends of the rock are covered in a zinc-colored powder that seemed to us to be... zinc. In the very structure of the rocks there is a zinc-colored hue. There seems to be iron here, judging by the color, consistency and weight of certain rocks seen there. We went down and Pacheco took some photos of the improvised architecture there for the annual festivals.
Wattle and daub, porches, carnauba straw and branches of bushes, trellises appear around here. The location is clumsy and systematically uneven. We left from there at 1 pm and arrived at 4:30 pm in @(Jaicós). Our hunger and thirst were quenched with some green watermelons that &(João) stole from a field. &(Pacheco) who was broke from the trip, drank water at the house of a #sertanejo


When I arrived, I had coffee, papaya, and muffins (the ones for breakfast).


[96]
The location of @(Serra) dos 3 irmãos is 5 leagues to the southwest of @(Jaicós).
&(Ladeira) and &(Martim) play backgammon. I went to check the condition of the radiator and then went back to check the backgammon. At 6 we had dinner, the same food as the previous meals. After dinner I spent some time on the sidewalk talking to &(Pacheco), &(Ladeira) watched by &(Martim).
They went for a coffee and &(João) came with 2 boys. Then I paid the horse explorer (24$000) and gave 6$000 to &(João) as a guide. One of the boys who came with the mixed-race João is a resident of @(Teresina) and gave me some information.
@(Teresina) - @(Rua Estrada do Gado) look for the &(Badô) = the ox toy
@(Estrada da Catarina) look for &(Manué) = maruja and congo.
@(Estrada de S. Raimundo) look for &(Joaquim) - likes to sing and play.
I went in to have a snack and talk with &(João). From here &(Martim) and &(Ladeira) continued the... chess championship and when it was over - 10 pm - I came to write today's report.
During the entire trip the sky was covered in clouds and it was windy. Only on the way back, in the late afternoon and near @(Jaicós), did it get a little sunny. This was a hot sun.


[97]
It seems that the truck's radiator will be converted this time. Calunga Bianô's father has been giving some expert advice on the subject and... only tomorrow morning. Everyone is already asleep and the priest's radio is working and my distraction during the day was singing verses from @(J. Pessoa)'s catimbó.
The young man from @(Terezina) told me that there is a train to @(S. Luiz) on the 3rd, 4th, 6th and Saturdays. Will we be able to catch the one on Saturday?! It's a bit cold here in @(Jaicos) tonight. Will this wind bother me? This is what I'm trying to do right now. Now that I'm almost over the flu I started the trip with, &(Ladeira) had taken the bottle of paint out of the coffin when I got back.
It must be 11pm at the latest. I'll go see the street and then go to sleep.


[98]

Photo 2 = respectable 19th century prison in @(Jaicós). photo taken at 5:30 pm.
Photo 3 = @(church of Our Lady of Mercy) in @(Jaicós). Photo taken at 5:30 pm when the sun was just hitting the tips of the church towers. In the background on the right you can see the roof of the market here, which is a single building with a porch on three sides only.
Today &(João) came to call me at 6 in the morning to say that the radiator only needed to be welded together a few small pieces. I woke up to get up at 8 in the morning. |. After breakfast I went to see the child. The rest of her injured part had been cemented, after all the radiator was cemented in almost the entire lower part. This seems like it will seriously harm its efficiency.
[drawing 98.1: unidentified drawing]


[99]
I've been trying to continue the trip with another truck since early morning. We're very late and things are going badly. This is our first blunder that depended on bad luck. It was really bad because we won't even have 10 days in @(Maranhão). After lunch I slept so much that I forgot what it's like to not sleep. Even now, in the afternoon I'm still sleepy. The cement on the radiator is drying and maybe we can leave at dawn tomorrow - 2 or 3 o'clock. During the day I tried to work on the conference that I have to send to @(J. Pessoa). Impossible to do anything. (this was written in the afternoon)
[drawing 99.1: Church of Jaicós and other buildings with trees and posts]


[100]
this was written at dinner time


dice = bozó / dice game = bozó game


A regional expression that is often used here is a very particular use of the adverb até (to). For example, we ask a local: how do you get from here to Picos by car? The guy answers: you can get there. We say to a local: from here, from @(Jaicós) to @(Morro 3 Irmãos) there are 3 leagues. He answers: you can get there. And so on.
23 hrs. Today, after dinner, I started writing the conference for &(Mário).
I was doing this when a truck belonging to a guy from @(Fortaleza) showed up and gave me some information about the trips in these areas. He said he had left @(Floriano) early this morning to arrive at @(Picos) at 11 am, making a total of 58 leagues to @(Jaicós) (he stopped for 5 hours in @(Picos) where he arrived at 7 pm). He also told me that they usually charge 1:800$000 for a truck charter from @(Teresina). He said there was a truck in @(Picos) that should leave for @(Teresina) tomorrow morning. We should leave for @(Picos) this morning when we get there.


[101]
tomorrow morning if nothing happens. It seems that now the radiator is completely cemented. This driver from @(Fortaleza) told us, however, that cementing done with pure cement breaks quickly. He usually mixes ½ of sand into the mortar. He also informed that he has already done this cementing service using cassava paste. I tried to send a telegram to @(Picos) proposing to the driver of the truck that leaves for @(Teresina) tomorrow (and who is at the Macedo guesthouse) to wait for us there. The guy on the telegraph told me that only tomorrow, at 7:50, could he get in touch with @(Picos). That's it. Then I went to play a game of pool with &(Pacheco). The balls of this carambola are... more or less round. The table is made of wood covered with cloth. The balls are made of dough. They charge 2$400 an hour. 2$500 for a guaraná from Brama. The custom here is that each player plays with one of the white pieces. After the game we go out and sit down to check


[102]
on the steps of the Church the echo system of the @(Jaicós) square. From certain places we can hear 3 to 4 repetitions of the sound. A clap is heard once very loudly and 2 others more weakly and in sounds very close to each other. The whistling gives the clear impression of frogs responding to each other. I then noticed that sometimes we can perfectly well be hearing just one frog and think we are hearing 3 or 4 of them. Endó Tiriri.
The people of this land are very slow. I was talking to &(Pacheco) that this is quieter than @(Carapicuiba). He said that he would not get used to this silence and the slowness of life here. I argued:
The guy comes here and lives his life. He knows that there is silence and nothing is done. It is true that there are some events in @(Jaicós). The chiming of the hours in the church, for example.


[103]
So he waits for the hour to strike, a little before it strikes. He waits slowly. It strikes. It will only strike half an hour later. About 10 minutes before the half hour he starts to wait, Slowly, It strikes. A little before lunch he waits for lunch because there is nothing to do. He waits slowly, because that is the only way. He waits. He has lunch. After lunch he has to wait for coffee. Slowly. After a certain time the guy starts to slow down little by little and completely stops. There, he got used to it.
When we were checking the echoes, I had the impression that someone would find it bad that we were whistling and clapping and, finally, talking there. As absurd as it may seem, I think I would agree with the person there who found it bad. Because what we were doing was a real attack on the most characteristic thing about the place: the silence. Just as it would agree with someone who complained that we were in a hurry to leave. Doing things slowly is also a characteristic of life in this place. Period. I'm going to sleep.


[104]
10-6-38 - I got up 30 minutes ago to see about the car repair business. I called &(João) and we went to get the radiator. I called &(Zé) and &(Biano). I was later helping to put the radiator in place. It's 2.45. The caboré is a bird that sings at night imitating any other bird. It eats them by attracting them like that. The people are awake and we should leave now. I bought a deer choir, cured and milled, for 75000.
Given &(Martim) 55000 (at this moment &(Martim) gave me 3 packs of cigarettes. 2 of 1,000 and one of $6000)
Departure from @(Jaicós) = 3.45. At 6.30 we will walk 6 leagues arriving at @(Fazenda dos Viados). The wattle and daub here consists of thick sticks that reach the height of the ceiling separated by the width of their diameter (+ or - 12 to 15 cms). This wattle and daub has few sticks

This photo no. 4 was taken in the morning, against the sun, with the camera sheltered in the shade of the house itself. Infinite distance. Camera lowered, yellow lens, aperture 4 and speed 85. This house is accompanied by a large corral and is located in a lowland of red earth and no grass. The semi-mountainous aspect of the surroundings is very similar to what can be seen when leaving São Paulo for the interior near the Tietê River. The corral is made of thick horizontal sticks 15 cm in diameter.
[drawing 106.1: small sketch of the corral fence]
Journey. The first hour and a half of the journey was made in the dark, but we could see the caatinga similar to that seen on the way to @(serra dos 3 irmãos). When we started to get to the hills, the caatinga became higher. It was already very light and we were descending a mountain.


[107]
The paths up to here have alternated between sand and sand and some sandy slopes.
After descending the mountain range, we enter a lowland (floodplain) where the vegetation changes very little. &(Zé) (the truck's calunga) informs us that this backlands is carrasco acatingado. And he gives the name to a tree called carrasca which he said is characteristic of the carrasco. However, here the ground is not stony.
The caatinga is very dry. &(João) says that the entire @(Piauí) is like this. However, we will soon verify the lie of his information because we found the bare lowland where the @(Fazenda dos Veados) is located. Every now and then the car would stop to put water in the radiator. Here on this farm I stopped and took a picture of the wattle and daub house (with stone, clay, porch etc. covered with tiles).
This floodplain is called @(Várzea dos Veados). In winter, cars spend days and days stuck here. Now the road is barely passable.


[108]
The headquarters of the @(Fazenda dos Veados) is a clean and dry plane. It gives the impression of a plain, although in these low and close areas it has this impression. Further on, also located on similar terrain, we find a group of houses that belong to the same farm. This group consists of 4 or 5 houses made of wattle and daub, covered with tiles and systematically oriented with an entrance perpendicular to the direction of the porch. Here also appears a detail that I have been finding in various places. In the swamps of Paraíba, we found it towards Muquem. Here in @(Ceará) and @(Piauí) we have also been finding it. It is as follows: the roof structure extends forward, sometimes one or two meters, but more generally the length of a compartment.


[109]
Sometimes the side walls of this open compartment in the façade are closed on the sides; other times, and this is even more common, they are closed only on the side where the wind is strongest. Sketching this detail from memory, I also noted the structure of the roof.


[drawing 109.1: sketch of a thatched roof building]


In the case of the houses on this @(Farm) the roofs are made of tiles and the walls are made of wattle and daub. It is rare for the more or less permanent houses in this area to have thatched roofs. Only the most miserable dwellings have thatched roofs.


[110]
from now on, written in @(Inhumas).
Particularly in this area of the last trip, near this farm, some houses scattered in the cleared yards are covered with carnauba straw. In fact, there is a lot of carnauba around here. Not as much, however, as further on, closer to @(Picos), after this farm we mentioned earlier and after another stretch of caatinga. Here in this floodplain there is a carnauba plantation. The arrangement of the plants is irregular, which gives the place a picturesque, unproblematic feel. More caatinga, more floodplain, more architecture and then @(Picos) at 8 in the morning. A coffee and then a lazy hammock until 1 pm when I got up like a madman to go and have a small and bad lunch.
After lunch I went to my room to write notes. I was at the beginning of this page when they called me to study the case of a truck that was coming from @(Crato) and could perhaps go to @(Teresina). After much gossip we reached an agreement for 500$000. So I went to do


[111]
83.20.45.15 = 163 x 6 = 97.8
10-6-38 Transportation bills from @(J. Pessoa) to @(Teresina).
cash in advance:
@(João Pessoa) $150,000

[112]
the other calunga is &(José Bianô), from @(Crato)
(days of @(Recife)


the bills with &(João). We discussed it and, so as not to fight, I made concessions to him. From there, still with 30$000 calungas (I had already given 10$000 to &(Zé)'s wife) Still spending on the calungas, 6$000 of cachaça. The note made with &(João) is on the pages at the end of this notebook and in no. 111. Before leaving, we had a coffee and I went to visit the @(Picos) cruise ship ($400 to the guide). There was nothing usable. Feet, uninteresting heads and hands. Nikeis stuck in a crack in the cross ship's pole. The pieces found there are hanging on the cross ship that is on the street. We left @(Picos) at 00:00. Caatinga and wattle and daub houses covered with sugar cane straw.
Mountain range with a hell of a slope. A bit of flat and another mountain range even steeper. We climbed a lot @(Picos) - @(Ipiranga) - @(Inhuma)
[drawing 112.1: profile of the climb between Picos, Ipiranga and Inhuma]
After the climb, there was a lot of sand, some cold and the sand was boiling hot in the ford that took us to @(Teresina). In @(Ipiranga) we came across a small village with no sensory area and no vegetation. The "street" is bare and windswept.


[113]
@(Ipiranga) 9.40 - spends coffee, brown sugar and sugarcane and cigarettes for the driver $7,000. We left Ipiranga through the caatinga, still in the same cold and with the same amount of sand. In @(Ipiranga) we bought cachaça and brown sugar and had coffee. We got to the square in @(Ipiranga). In @(Inhumas) (3 and ½ leagues after Ipiranga) we arrived on time. We got to the square in the square, and stopped right under a large tree. The truck then went to the door of @(Pensão S. José). The radio isn't even working. The guesthouse has a small, more or less, very pretty place. I think that very pretty means very cool because I'm in a desperate state of catuabism. Here in this guesthouse I ate 2 eggs with dried meat paçoca and coffee. Passengers from the truck who had promised me to be there today in @(Picos) are chatting. It seems that among them there is a thin, sexless and boring woman who travels after her husband.


[114]
The conversation is about kings and harpoon escapes. Silly conversations. In this guesthouse the quantity and variety of types of lamps is remarkable.
[drawing 114.1: lamp]
Tomorrow morning we should leave. The conversation between them got to the point where a guy said that a girl had fallen for a married guy and his wife came to find out about the mess.
I gave $2,000 to the Calangos
the guy is characteristically very stupid


11-6-38 Saturday we got up at 6 o'clock. The truck went to unload part of the cargo - Kerozene that it was bringing. We had coffee with tapioca rolls. Here in @(Piauí) they don't know about bread, almost only in @(Teresina)
In @(Boa Esperança) there is an ox toy
In @(Picos) there is an ox toy
In @(Floriano) there are oxen and congo kings.


[115]
Here on the wall there is a notice written in ink on silver paper:


Attention
Ynhumense!... here it is
your car, look and examine

Lunch at @(Coroatá) Sleeping at Cantinho
2nd Christmas Lunch - Dinner


[116]
Here in @(Inhuma) we live off sugarcane. There are many sugar mills around here. Predominantly sugar mills.
The solution of the back of the house in the form of a porch is normal both in @(Picos) and here in @(Inhuma). The house is usually developed like this


[drawing 116.1: floor plan sketch]
1 kitchen
2 pantry
3 maids room or room
4, 9, 10, 11 bedroom
Sets 5 and 6 are sometimes resolved into a single room and others into 2, 3 or even 4 rooms. 8 is a hallway. 7 is the dining room where the water pot is located. The arrow indicates the porch with a parapet and railing that generally goes all the way to the kitchen.


[117]
Here in @(Inhuma) bricks are widely used. In fact, this brick here in @(Piauí) is popular, baked in ovens and made of dark clay mixed with grass.
[drawing 117.1: sketch of the brick oven]
1.80 m x 1.3 m
It is not uncommon to see baked bricks made of light clay. These houses are almost systematically uncovered so that the bricks can be seen. Here in @(Inhumas), there are only two parapets in the square, one certainly from 1937 and the other from a few years ago. The rest are made of beaks. They are unloading truck 7.15.
The market here is square, recent, and has a porch inside.
The roof is a single stream of water falling into the central courtyard. It has two entrances. In fact, there are many entrances, but the others besides these two are passages through the stalls. There are a lot of swallows in this market.
The big tree we stopped under yesterday is a tamarind tree.


[118]
Departure from @(Inhuma) 8:30. Road through caatinga and backlands, caatinga and backlands again. We chased some siriemas. The best wood for XXX is yellow and sage. (report from @Ceará) Arapiraca takes a varnish and serves as a shotgun crown and construction (still @(Ceará) Here in this place between @(Inhuma) and @(Valença) is the @(Canndêia). The visguêro tree (or farêra as they say here) the cattle eating the fruit and the bean of it).

seven leagues away
There are a lot of goats who are like mares
who denies even a piqui.


There are a lot of anteaters raised here. More anteaters.
there is a rush hour on the road between @(Valença) and @(Coroatá)
(only in the agreste and caatinga areas (the agreste is characterized by a grass called agreste. In principle, the agreste is more park-like than the caatinga.


[129]
We left Valença at 1:00 p.m. From there on we encountered caatinga and wild land for a short time and then came across a floodplain that went on for 1 league from @(Coroatá). 5 leagues before @(Coroatá) there is a river with a stone bed and almost dry. This river, like others that we will encounter up to @(Coroatá) has wooden bridges. We stopped at this river and I went to talk to a cowboy with a long jerkin that reached halfway down his thigh. This cowboy informed us that in 3 leagues (therefore 2 leagues from @(Coroatá) we would find a @(Tapera farm).
In fact, after walking 3 leagues on a very poor road, closer (where we caught a turtle that we later threw back into the river), there was a parked floodplain where the vast and enormous Piauiense cattle grazed, and siriemas or xexéus (any hawks too) appeared.


[130]
we found this farm where we drank dirty water. The sun was blazing and we felt like resting but... we continued the journey. We continued the journey through the floodplains until 1 ⁄ 2 of @(Coroatá) where we entered... @(Cantareira) of @(São Paulo). Pure forest. Water and deer. Normally tall trees. Vines. Clean and smooth grass. Some cowboys who were returning from the @(Coroatá) fair. The popular architecture here presents a new detail. The roof systematically has at least 3 slopes. The process of combining them is that the 2 slopes that are at the ends of the eaves are under the others

The process of holding the cape is with two sticks tied at one end and placed on the two slopes
[drawing 130.2: sketch of the roof timber in view]


[drawing 130.3: sketch of the roof timber in section]
The walls are made of wattle and daub


[131]
The reports given by the people here are remarkable. When the wheel is large, the distance is, for example, 10 leagues. When it is small, it is about leagues. This is just one example.
Another: if you asked here in @(Coroatá) what the distance was between @(Cantinho) and @(Barro Duro) the guy said 4 kilometers, another guy who was on the other side said 1 league and the one who said it was 4 km said, taking a few steps, that it was 3 kilometers.
The current name of @(Coroatá) is @(Elesbão Veloso).
We had coffee with cookies, guarana and beer

Arrival at @(Cantinho) 23:30. The journey from @(Coroata) to @(Cantinho) was made on a road that was not as bad as the information said it would be. A little bit of caatinga and the rest of the country. The country is fixed to me; it is like this: grassy fields (or with wild grass) and trees here and there. Just before arriving at @(Cantinho), you come across a thicket of coconut trees that goes all the way to the city.
We arrived at 11:30 pm and there was nothing to eat at the guesthouse. I went to Martim to listen to some samba that we had heard since we entered the city. The samba was a dansoría beasta with marchinha, choros (sambinha) etc. Then I was kindly welcomed by the host of the party. I bought cornmeal cake (made with cornmeal and brown sugar) which I thought was delicious (was I really hungry?) and brought it to the others.
Give explanations to the driver about geomechanics.

Arrival at @(Barro Duro) (3 kilometers from @(Cantinho) and 7 leagues from @(Natal) at 8 o'clock. This area supplies @(Piauí) with cereals. Things are sold by the quarter (50 kilos). Corn, for example, costs $3,000 per quarter.
The internal architecture is the same as @(Cantinho). &(Pacheco) took a photo of a market in @(Cantinho) that I didn't notice. There are a lot of mulattos and mixed-race people here. Banana trees, papayas, oranges.
Very large hoses.

Windowsill. They don't use the word alpendre for a porch that is half-closed by a windowsill. They call this a small porch.
A porch is when it is completely open. Furquia. They use the phrase taipo to designate a wattle and daub.

The babassu stalks from which this house is made have two different placement techniques: one on the roof and the other on the walls.


[144]
The roof one systematically appears with the leaves of the highest stem falling over the leaves of the immediately lower stem.
[drawing 144.1: roof detail]
On walls, in general, the leaves of the upper stem (the horizontal placement of the stem is systematic, with very few exceptions) fall inside the stem immediately below.
[drawing 144.2: detail of the timber]


[145]
Sometimes the same leaf placement technique used on the roof can be found on the walls. This gives the house a contrasting appearance with the ones made with the stems showing.
@(Coroatá) 9 hours


In these stems, the horizontality of the stems appears and predominates and sometimes acquires richness of movement and beauty of chiaroscuro when well executed. In the stem below, the horizontality of the lines disappears, giving way to more rounded shapes rising from the ground in an outward concavity as if it were a continuation
[drawing 145.1: unidentified sketch]


[146]
Doors and windows made of woven straw (babassu) are common here and are called "estêra" doors or windows. The technique for making this woven material is different from that found in the northeast (Pernambuco) and (Paraiba), where the whole is divided equally into 2 parts by the straw stalk, with 3 stalks appearing; 2 on the edges and one in the middle. The technique of roofing with more than 2 slopes has been firmly established here. The wattle and daub technique that has emerged here is more similar to that found in (São Paulo). It is true that the appearance is more complete and the shapes are more refined.


[147]
Small stop in @(Conceição) 10.30 straw and wattle and daub house. Just one street
One thing of interest that has been appearing since @(Piauí) (near Teresina), intensified greatly in the capital of this state of @(Piauí), is the red color of ox blood in the painting of the houses. I still don't know what they make this paint with, it must be with some mineral that is easily found around here.
Last night I visited the city of @(Caxias)
@(Conceição) 10:30 - 14-6-38
This stop does not have a station, the town consists of a street that runs on either side of the line. Tall mango trees.


[148]
In the houses here, there is an interesting detail in the way the straw is tied to the walls. Instead of passing under the lower stalk, as in the following stalks, the last stalk at the top passes over it. The straw is tied to the top of the ridge by folding the babassu stalk, without the bend. The pau-a-pique technique has been using the (plucked) babassu stalk as rods for braiding the horizontal elements since long ago (before Codó).
Sometimes the stems pierce the window openings, barring them. We also observed a certain system of doors,


[149]
windows and even walls of corrals and, rarely, one or two walls of houses made only with the babassu stalks connected parallel to each other. The connection is made by drilling the stalk in two or three places and passing the connection line through this hole.

We arrived at @(Caxias) at 6:15 pm. A traveler had told us that there was a very magnificent bathroom in a guesthouse where the water was not bad. We got off and... went looking for the guesthouse. In front of the station there was nothing but mud and weeds. To the right there was a wide road or street. It went far away. Finally, I asked the train chief where we should stay. He said it was the &(João Paulo) guesthouse. So we left all our luggage in the car. We stayed in a ground floor room with a door to the outside and 4 windows. We slept in hammocks. All of us. Before dinner I went to take advantage of the magnificent shower that was recommended. The shower was, in fact, very good for the place, but the light was dim and I broke the laces of my boots that had gotten tangled in the dark.


[152]

the terreiro and among themselves also to the sound of another toada. In this toada there is a different dance | of a collective circle but a step not yet filmed. The body is somewhat curved and the movement of the feet is like this

The dance is now a circle dance, however

to help me because I am bedridden.
Report of the day: In the morning I got up and immediately went to get a license at 8 o'clock to operate a section of the "tambô de mina" in the neighborhood of & (João Paulo). At the police headquarters they informed me that I could only get an order of this nature from the police chief & (Dr. Flavio Bezerra). I took a car and went to his house. I handed over my card and a little while later the lady showed up saying that her husband apologized for not being a man, big, majestic, perhaps good. We talked and I told her why I had come. She went inside and then came back a little while later asking where I wanted to find the order. I answered, went and came back saying that at 3 o'clock in the afternoon I could look for the order at the police headquarters. I explained to her again that I was in a hurry and very interested in being able to work today in the morning.


They usually dance in a circle, to a different rhythm and tune.

She went back inside and a few minutes later the Chief of Police came in, dressed in his pajamas and furious, saying that he was bedridden, had a fever, that I had come at the last minute demanding that he hurry, etc. etc. I was full of apologies on the outside and on the inside I was seething with rage. He gradually won over and finally agreed. He asked me to wait a while and after about 15 minutes he showed up dressed and invited me to accompany him to the Police Station. We each left in our own car. At the Police Station he treated me very well - a huge difference from the first time - and gave me his card - a bit of a jerk but helpful after all. He must be a great police chief... for the government.
Then I went to ÚLI where I spoke to the manager, who is a stupid and dumb Englishman. I didn't get anything despite singing it in every possible way.


[187]
I left there pissed off and came to get &(Martim) and tell &(Pacheco) and &(Ladeira) to take the equipment to &(J. Paulo) so we could work. With &(Martim) I went to &(João Paulo). &(Pacheco) and &(Ladeira) only arrived at 11:30. We unloaded the equipment, danced a bit and sang to write down the material that needed to be worked on, and then we came to lunch.
In the afternoon we worked until 6 o'clock. At lunch and dinner time, &(Ladeira) stayed in charge of the equipment and had lunch and dinner afterwards. While he was eating dinner I found out that &(Paulo Barreto) had been looking for him. After dinner I went to look for him and we went together with the Cuban who lives with him to the "tambô de mina". Then &(Pacheco) noticed that there was a problem with the recording machine and we decided to go back until the equipment was fixed. &(P. Barreto) and his companion left first. I stayed there writing down the songs and details of the dance they performed. I suggested to &(Martim) to secure the material by trying to write down the lines they sang, and at 10:30 pm we came home. I went to have a snack with &(Pacheco) and spent around 2$000 on water.
